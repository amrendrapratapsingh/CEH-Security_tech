#####  Firewall ###


1) It acts like a ACL.

2)it protect inside the network from outside unauthorizded network.

3) firewall can do packet level filtering which is similar to ACL.

4)Nowdays firewall is stateful inspection.



##### basically three zones of Firewall ####

1) DMZ.
2) Inside Zone.
3) OutSide Zone.



***UTM => Unified threat Management ***** can filter packets base on Layer3 , layer4 as wellas application
layer data such as payload.

**) Attackers can use  tools for scanning the ports (nmap,zenmap)




****** PORT ***
DNS - TCP/UDP:53   => Domain to 

** Attcakers can try with some well known ports to get reply from firewall 

1) SNMP  - TCP:161
2)HTTPS - TCP:443
3)HTTP -  TCP:80
4)Telnet - TCP:23
5)SSH - TCP-22
6)FTP - TCP:21,20
7)DNS - TCP/UDP:53
8)SMB - TCP:445



***** Attackers can also use other techniques such as 

*) IP spoofing.
*) Source Routing.
*) Tiny Fragments
*) URL filter skip by IP Address
*) Proxy servers
*) Tunnelling protocols.


Note : TO secure our networks we must use a firewall which runs SSL Decryption and Application Layer inspection.
